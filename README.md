# **School District Analysis**

## **Overview**

The purpose of the analysis stemmed from Maria and her supervisor being notified of evidence that shows academic dishonesty for reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. Maria has asked us to replace the suspected fabricated scores with “NaNs” while keeping the rest of the data intact. She would then like us to rerun the analysis and write up a report after removing the suspected fabricated data. 

### **Results**

#### **District Summary**

The district summary was affected negatively after we removed the fabricated results from the data. All fields were affected with the exception of Average Reading Score %. Please see the comparison in the images below:

As shown in the images, although the effects were by a small margin, they fabricated data did effect the data negatively. 

#### **School Summary**

The school summary was also affected by the suspected fabricated data. Thomas High School had an overall passing percentage of 91% before the data was cleaned up. However, after the suspected data was removed, their overall passing percentage dropped down significantly to 65%. This also effected them in the rankings going from second place, all the way down to eight, making them the worse charter school in the district.

#### **The Results**

All negative changes as a  result of removing the suspected fabricated reading and math scores from Thomas High School ninth graders. 

##### **Revising the data and replacing the ninth grade scores has affected the following:**

###### **Math and Reading Scores by Grade:**

Pre Revision: Thomas High School Total Number of Students:  1635
Post Revision: Thomas High School Total Number of Students: 1174
The passing score has dropped significantly due to the number of students remaining the same, but the number of students passing has dropped since we removed the 9th graders.

Post Revision: 67, 77, 56
 
###### **Scores by School Size:**

Thomas High School is located in the Medium “(1000-2000)” size bin. Removing the ninth graders have changed the data from:

Pre Revision: 94, 97, 91

###### **Scores by School Type:** 

Thomas High School is located in the Charter bin. The data affected are as follows:

Pre Revision: 94, 97, 90
Post Revision: 90, 93, 87

#### **Conclusion**

In conclusion the revised data may have slight changes to some fields and larger differences in others. However, the overall effect was significant.

Thomas High School dropped in the ratings from 2nd to 8th place as a result of removing the math and reading scores of the 9th graders in their High School. They went from the best second best ranking charter school in the district to the worse. After the scores were adjusted, they were ultimately reduced to zero grade which resulting in them all failing.

Ultimately, after reviewing the data, a huge and significant negative impact for the school. However, hopefully Maria, her supervisor and the School Board may now make a clear decision on their budgeting.
